# Olist_project
Data science project using data from a Brazilian e-commerce company called Olist. SQL, Python, Exploratory analysis skills and Machine Learning were used to accomplish this project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
**The present dataset has different data sources, each table specifying a topic of e-commerce sales. The tables are separated into:** 
1. Costumers
2. Geolocation
3. Orders
4. Order items
5. Payments
6. Order reviews
7. Products 
8. Sellers
9. Product category name

## Classification Problem - Machine Learning with Random Forest and XGBoost

In the present project I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis** on each of the tables to better understand the influence by category on Olist's business. Later, **using SQL language**, I created a Big table with the union between all the tables and performed a new exploratory analysis with confrontations between the most diverse features of the dataset.
After creating the unified table and conducted the Exploratory Data Analysis, I performed **feature engineering, manipulating and transforming** the existing variables to create new relevant features for the problem at hand.

Next, I defined the **target variable representing the review score and applied classification models**. I utilized **Random Forest and XGBoost**, popular algorithms for classification problems in machine learning, to predict and classify the data based on the available features.**

**These additional steps of feature engineering and applying classification models allow for exploring patterns in the data, building a predictive model, and making decisions based on the obtained insights.**

Note that the process of exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and applying machine learning models can be iterative, involving testing, adjusting, and continuous evaluation of the results.


## Data Schema

The data is divided in multiple datasets for better understanding and organization.
