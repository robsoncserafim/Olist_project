## Exploratory Data Analysis
**The present dataset has different data sources, each table specifying a topic of e-commerce sales. The tables are separated into:** 
1. Costumers
2. Geolocation
3. Orders
4. Order items
5. Payments
6. Order reviews
7. Products 
8. Sellers
9. Product category name

**In the present project I performed exploratory data analysis on each of the tables to better understand the influence by category on Olist's business. Later, using SQL language, I created a Big table with the union between all the tables and performed a new exploratory analysis with confrontations between the most diverse features of the dataset.**


## Data Schema

The data is divided in multiple datasets for better understanding and organization.
